Documentation for Preload Images Module
Overview
This module is designed to preload images across the entire React application to enhance user experience by reducing image load times. By preloading images, we ensure that they are already cached in the browser before they are needed, allowing components with images to render faster when accessed.

The preloading process leverages two complementary techniques:

JavaScript Image Object: Images are preloaded programmatically using the native Image object in JavaScript. This method forces the browser to download the images as soon as the component is mounted, regardless of whether the images are currently in view.

HTML <link rel="preload"> Tags: The component also uses the <link rel="preload"> HTML tag to inform the browser to preload specific images. This helps browsers that support the tag to prioritize and efficiently load the images in advance, further optimizing performance.

How It Works
Image Configuration: All the images that need to be preloaded are listed in a configuration file. This file contains the paths to the images and their alternative text (alt attributes). This makes it easier to manage and update the images to be preloaded.

Preloading via JavaScript: Upon mounting the component, a function is triggered that uses the Image object to download each image in the background. This ensures that the images are downloaded and ready for display before they are actually rendered on the screen.

Preloading via <link rel="preload"> Tags: In addition to using the JavaScript method, the component injects <link rel="preload"> tags into the HTML document's head section. These tags instruct the browser to begin downloading the images immediately, helping ensure that resources are loaded in a non-blocking manner for improved performance.

Benefits
Faster Image Display: Since the images are preloaded before they are needed, there is no delay in rendering them when the user navigates to a page or section containing those images. This improves the perceived performance and user experience.

Optimized Resource Management: Using <link rel="preload"> tags ensures that the browser handles image loading efficiently, prioritizing preloaded resources in the best possible way.

How to Use It
Add Images: Images to be preloaded should be added to the image configuration file. The configuration file contains all necessary information, such as the image source and alt text.

Component Integration: The preloading component should be added to your main React application or any specific part of the app where you want the images to be preloaded before the user interacts with them.

Maintenance: The image configuration file can be easily updated to add or remove images, making it highly maintainable and scalable for larger projects.

Conclusion
This preloading module ensures that images load faster by downloading them before they are required, significantly improving the performance of image-heavy applications. By combining JavaScript and HTML preloading techniques, we ensure broad compatibility and optimal resource management across different browsers and devices.
